¿Are you asking for me still?
See through
I get lost again
And you walk
Stranger
You can have it all
And in a way I'm never gonna die
And the sun reaches in his sky
No
It's alright
I can't go home again
Just like before

You'd better get it before it goes
You'd you better get it before it goes
Son, you better get it before it goes

And when the cold comes in your eyes
Just tell the truth
Everything will be alright
(You'd better get it before it goes)
I told you why I wouldn't wait for a try
You waste your energy trying to find
(You'd better get it before it goes)

And with the lost soul
Look in my eyes
Cause tonight they'll sign your name in the skies
Wait
It's alright
Tell me what's wrong

Son you'd better get it before it goes
You'd better get it before it goes
Son you'd better get it before it goes

And when the cold comes in your eyes
Just tell the truth
Everything will be alright
I told you why I wouldn't wait for a try
You waste your energy trying to find
Are they asking for me still?
Safe light
I'll get lost again and you walk
Stranger
You can't have it all
Baby, I'm never gonna die
And the sun reaches into the sky
No
It's alright
I can't go home again just like before
