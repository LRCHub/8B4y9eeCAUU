Clap your hands to the music
Doo doop, doo

Yeah, yeah (get up, get up)
Yeah, yeah (get up, get up)

Take your hands from your pocket from behind your back
Put them all together, show me where it's at, y'all
(Clap your hands to the music)
I dig the funky music without a doubt
Glad you're in the groove is what it's all about, c'mon
(Clap your hands to the music)

Just let the music get to you
And you start to tap your foot to the rhythm
Can't you feel the rhythm gets stronger (stronger)
And before it's gone, join in this song

Clap your hands to the music
Shooby dooby
Clap your hands to the music
Shooby dooby

To those who could never get up and dance
You don't need your feet, you just use your hands
(Clap your hands to the music)
Get up all with the music let it all hang out
Andif you want it, you can even shout, c'mon
(Clap your hands to the music)

Just let the music get to you
And you start to tap your foot to the rhythm
Can't you feel the rhythm gets stronger (stronger)
And before it's gone, join in this song

(Clap your hands to the music) yeah, yeah
(Shooby dooby) c'mon now
(Clap your hands to the music)
(Shooby dooby)

(Doo doop, doo doop)
(Doo doop, doo doop)
Before it's gone (before it's gone, before it's gone)
Join in this song (get up, get up)
(Get up, get it)

(Clap your hands to the music) yeah, yeah
(Shooby dooby) c'mon now
(Clap your hands to the music) put them all together
(Shooby dooby)
(Clap your hands to the music) you don't need your feet
(Shooby dooby) to clap to the beat
(Clap your hands to the music) put them all together
(Shooby dooby) c'mon now
(Clap your hands to the music) you don't need to dance
(Shooby dooby) just use your hands
(Clap your hands to the music)
May I hear some rhythm, please? (shooby dooby)

C'mon, clap your hands (clap your hands to the music)
