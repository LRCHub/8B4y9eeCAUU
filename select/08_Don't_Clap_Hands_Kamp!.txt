Can't live the moment like this
The things you loose
Are the things you miss
I never hope we learn
It's such a shame it ends like this, whoa

I can tell what it means
To live the broken dreams
Then I begin to feel
I can tell you 'bout my fears
You better save your tears
Don't fall behind

I can tell you to be mean
And nothing's ever green
Then I begin to feel
I can feel the change coming
Knockin' on the door
We locked it from behind, behind

Don't clap hands
And nothing now really matters
And nothing now really matters
Since you've stopped trying

I can show you what it means
To poison all your dreams
Then I begin to feel
I can feel now what it means
The breaking all the deals
I saw them die

I can tell you to be wise
And be the one who tries
Then I begin to feel
Like the tap's been left running
I hear the water drop
And you don't even mind

But don't clap hands
And nothing now really matters
And nothing now really matters
Since you've stopped trying

Can't live the moment like this
The things you loose
Are the things you miss
I never hope we learn
It's such a shame it ends like
Shame it ends like
Shame it ends like this

Don't clap hands
And nothing gets really better
And nothing gets really better
Since you've stopped trying

Don't shake heads
And nothing gets really better
And nothing gets really better
Since you've stopped trying
