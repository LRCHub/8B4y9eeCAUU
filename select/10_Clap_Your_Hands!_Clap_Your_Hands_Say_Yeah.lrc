[00:07.16] Run the lip off sunshine shore
[00:10.20] Betray white water
[00:12.27] Delay dark forms
[00:13.53] Slap young waves on wooden bones
[00:15.96] Don't touch the laughter and away we go
[00:35.46] 
[00:19.86] Away we go
[00:24.86] 
[00:32.82] CLAP YOUR HANDS!
[00:35.99] But I feel so lonely
[00:37.83] CLAP YOUR HANDS!
[00:39.42] But it won't do nothing
[00:41.27] CLAP YOUR HANDS!
[00:42.62] But I have no money
[00:44.43] CLAP YOUR HANDS!
[00:46.04] Are you up to something?
[00:47.93] CLAP YOUR HANDS!
[00:49.39] Where's my milk and honey?
[00:51.49] CLAP YOUR HANDS!
[00:52.59] But I just look funny
[01:03.09] 
[00:54.76] CLAP YOUR HANDS!
[00:57.76] I'll just wait awhile
[01:08.26] 
[01:01.03] As time alone stands still for some
[01:04.74] Stuffed sailor up with eyeball sun
[01:08.84] And if by castle ship should stray
[01:12.33] It has like you no chosen fate for
[01:15.97] It's tongue-tied caboose that leads
[01:19.58] This ragged lad, this finger-flipping
[01:22.10] Mom and dad (for what is worth some
[01:25.24] Aimless steer?) And should mouth
[01:27.70] Confuse my foggy mirror and reveal
[01:32.17] What is not there I shall take this
[01:33.66] Unbound train away...
